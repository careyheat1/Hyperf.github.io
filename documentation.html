            <strong> What is HyPerf?</strong><br>
            ---------------<br>
            HyPerf stands for (Hy)per (Perf)ormance, or if you'd rather, Hy (Perf)ormance.<br>
            Either way, it is about giving the user a method of over-performing what they<br>
            can normally do with their Free and Open Source (FOSS) environments, tools, and<br>
            skills.<br>
            <br>
            HyPerf is:<br>
            * A Project<br>
            * A Paradigm<br>
            * A Toolkit<br>
            <br>
            **The Project** --<br>
            HyPerf is this FOSS project dedicated to helping Linux power users, engineers,<br>
            and administrators make the most of their Linux skills by providing them an easy<br>
            means of taking those skills with them from instance to instance, server to<br>
            server, project to project, and job to job.<br>
            <br>
            **The Paradigm** --<br>
            HyPerf is also a paradigm associated with the project that breaks from<br>
            traditional Unix methodology: In the classic Unix paradigm, one has a single<br>
            tool to do a single job. This means there are many different, important, and<br>
            powerful tools spread throughout many disparate projects and varied packages.<br>
            Such a broad dispersal of tools can be detrimental when it comes to:<br>
            * Skilling-up for GNU/Linux environment beginners<br>
            <br>
            * Collating those skills and tools for intermediate and power users<br>
            <br>
            * Maintaining those skills at a professional level over an entire career<br>
            that is evolving with rapidly-changing technology fields and stacks.<br>
            <br>
            It's tough out there, and very competitive! :-)<br>
            <br>
            The HyPerf project utilizes a different paradigm than the classic 1-tool/1-job<br>
            paradigm of Unix. The HyPerf philosophy considers the entire mass of code,<br>
            tools, and experiences needed to be successful in information technology as a<br>
            set bound together by key skills in the GNU/Linux Environment and Tools (GLET),<br>
            which is itself just a set of core tools that include...<br>
            * Vim<br>
            * Bash (The GNU shell)<br>
            * The Linux Kernel<br>
            * The util-linux package tools<br>
            * The other core components of the GNU environment<br>
            - GNU build chain<br>
            - GNU coreutils package tools<br>
            - Other key GNU tools (find, grep, sed, awk, etc., etc.)<br>
            * and other disparate tools spread out all over the place.<br>
            <br>
            The HyPerf project puts its paradigm and methodology into practice by providing<br>
            a single, primary kit called the HyPert ToolKit.<br>
            <br>
            NOTE: The HyPerf paradigm considers all of the tools such as the Linux<br>
            Kernel's **util-linux** and the GNU **coreutils** packages, plus<br>
            all of the other key tools that one would expect to be in a<br>
            standard Linux-like setup to be a toolset called<br>
            **"coreutilinux"**.<br>
            <br>
            Essentially:<br>
            * The GNU/Linux Environment and Tools packages<br>
            * The Linux util-linux toolset package<br>
            * The GNU coreutils toolset package<br>
            <br>
            An even shorter term that HyPerf uses to reference the entire<br>
            Linux-like environment is just to call the whole thing "GLET",<br>
            which effectively means the same thing, so...<br>
            <br>
            GLET = GNU/Linux Environment and Tools<br>
            <br>
            This paradigm makes things easier for the individual to identify, manage, and<br>
            deal with all of those career-long skill as a single thing: a kit.<br>
            <br>
            **The Toolkit** --<br>
            Finally, and just as important, HyPerf is **a toolkit**. Specifically, the<br>
            **htk.sh** file that you can see at the top of its Git repo. The HTK has many<br>
            tools and configuration settings included in the kit, for use in situations<br>
            where having a single toolkit file helps the user to keep track of HyPerf's (or<br>
            their own) tools, configurations, skills, and knowledge, instead of having to<br>
            deal with multiple packages, files, skills, experience, bookmarks, etc.<br>
            <br>
            In other words, HyPerf let's you have my 20ish years of experience (is it 20<br>
            years now? Whew!) compiled down to an object that you can utilize wherever to<br>
            can get to it and are able. If you don't like my skills and tools, you can use<br>
            your own concept and "re-compile" them for your own use, and patch things to<br>
            'fix' broken stuff of mine, etc., etc.<br>
            <br>
            So *HOW* do you take your skills from place to place, from system to system,<br>
            from job to job?<br>
            <br>
            Use a kit!<br>
            <br>
            Similar to the way Infrastructure as Code (IaC) gives its DevOps practitioners<br>
            incredible advantages, Skills as a Kit (SaaK?) gives users incredible super<br>
            powers in working with the tech that is all around and available to most<br>
            professionals today. HyPerf acts as a unified object (project + paradigm +<br>
            toolkit) that represents an entire career's worth of skill, thought, and<br>
            muscle-memory codified into a single object that you can take with you.<br>
            <br>
            I know I certainly do.<br>
            <br>
            Since I started the project, I have used it everywhere that I have<br>
            professionally worked with tech, and it has been a valuable resource that has<br>
            given me advantages in my work, despite being surrounded by superior colleagues,<br>
            career pivots, challenging work environments, and work paces that I could not<br>
            have sustained without it.<br>

            <strong>Where did the HyPerf project originate?</strong><br>
            ---------------------------------------<br>
            HyPerf used to be a BSD licensed SourceForge project that I created and<br>
            maintained when I worked at Novell/SUSE in its Advanced Technical Training (ATT)<br>
            department. That project was called 'Mooty' back then, and it was released with<br>
            the blessing of Novell's Open Source Review Board (OSRB).<br>
            <br>
            I forked the HyPerf project from Mooty when I left Novell/SUSE, some years ago.<br>
            The Mooty project was abandoned at that point and this project is no longer<br>
            associated with that one at all.<br>

        <div id="q3">
            <strong>What are the HyPerf project objectives?</strong><br>
            ---------------------------------------<br>
            These are the main objectives of the HyPerf project:<br>
            * To leverage the power of the primary, default Linux user interface tools:<br>
            - The Vim Editor<br>
            - The Bash Shell<br>
            - The Linux Kernel<br>
            - The GNU Tool Set<br>
            * To offer **powerful** default configuration settings to users<br>
            * To make the use of a system be as fast and as easy for the user as possible<br>
            * To provide a means of extending power user, administrator, and engineer skills<br>
            * To provide a framework for easy ad-hoc mass management<br>
            * To provide a standardized, open source means of transferring Linux skills<br>
            between systems and even between employments<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="q4">
            <strong>What is the HTK, in a nutshell?</strong><br>
            -------------------------------<br>
            The HTK is a multi-function installer, toolkit, and payload **bash script** that<br>
            acts as the primary delivery mechanism (and deliverable) of the HyPerf project.<br>
            <br>
            The HTK is an attempt to fulfill the listed objectives of the project by having<br>
            a single toolkit script file to download from the project, with all of the tools<br>
            included within.<br>
            <br>
            The toolkit, called 'The HyPerf ToolKit' or just 'HTK', allows users to leverage<br>
            native features of GLET, without having to add on a lot of additional packages<br>
            to the system in order for itself to be useful.<br>
            <br>
            For the most part, there is really only a single file to download:<br>
            **htk.sh**<br>
            <br>
            You may see an optional extension included with that name, depending on how you<br>
            got the HTK. It may look something like this:<br>
            **htk.sh--0.5.18--20200127204233**<br>
            <br>
            The long extension, beginning with double-dashes, just indicates when the kit<br>
            was built. The extension name is not required for the kit to work, it simply<br>
            makes it easy to tell, by filename, which version it is.<br>
            <br>
            The version can also be obtained by executing **"bash htk.sh -v"**.<br>
            <br>
            As for the code of the htk.sh file, it is written entirely in Bash, so it should<br>
            be pretty easy to read and understand, assuming you understand bash scripting.<br>
            The code is filled with documentation and self-help features to make it easy to<br>
            learn what it is doing underneath.<br>
            <br>
            The HTK makes it easy to do mass amounts of work in various GLET environments.<br>
            These are the primary environments where I have used it:<br>
            * Pure SUSE Linux workstations<br>
            * Myriad other Linux servers (SUSE, Redhat, Centos, Debian, Ubuntu, Amazon<br>
            Linux, etc.)<br>
            * Cygwin (w/ MinTTY, on Windows workstations)<br>
            * Hombrew + iTerm2 (Mac OS X).<br>
            <br>
            The HTK includes a number of major features for applying the HyPerf Paradigm to<br>
            GLET systems.<br>
            <br>
            It is BSD licensed code (other than an included, modified copy of the Bash Man<br>
            Page, which is GPL licensed), so other than that man page, users can copy and<br>
            use the HTK any way they want, with one caveat: **HYPERF IS NOT SUPPORTED AT<br>
            ALL, IN ANY WAY. See the license for details.**<br>
            <br>
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            NOTE: I do **NOT** warranty the HTK from damaging your system.<br>
            I do **NOT** guarantee its functionality in any way.<br>
            I do **NOT** offer **ANY** form of warranty or guarantee.<br>
            <br>
            I **DO** advise you to make backups of your systems before using<br>
            any tool such as the HTK (htk.sh).<br>
            <br>
            I **DO** advise you that when using **ANY TOOL** from the HyPerf<br>
            project, you are doing so at your own risk.<br>
            <br>
            If those conditions are not acceptable to you, do **NOT use<br>
            anything from the HyPerf project!!!<br>

            <strong>What are the primary features of the HTK?</strong><br>
            -----------------------------------------<br>
            The HTK comes with myriad sub-tools, collated from over 20 years working GLET<br>
